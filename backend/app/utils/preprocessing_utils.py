    from an image. These features are commonly used in texture analysis and image processing.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    rlMatrix : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D Gray-Level Run-Length Matrix (GLRLM) computed from an image. The rows represent
        intensity levels, and the columns represent run lengths.

    image : numpy.ndarray
        The original 2D image from which the GLRLM was derived. This is used to determine
        the number of gray levels and the total number of pixels.

    Returns:
    --------
    features : dict
        A dictionary containing the following texture features:
        - "Short Run Emphasis"          : Emphasizes short runs in the image.
        - "Long Run Emphasis"           : Emphasizes long runs in the image.
        - "Gray Level Non-Uniformity"   : Measures the variability of gray levels.
        - "Run Length Non-Uniformity"   : Measures the variability of run lengths.
        - "Run Percentage"              : Ratio of runs to the total number of pixels.
        - "Low Gray Level Run Emphasis" : Emphasizes runs with low gray levels.
        - "High Gray Level Run Emphasis": Emphasizes runs with high gray levels.
